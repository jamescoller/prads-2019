	abstract = {On February 4, 2008, Admiral Paul Sullivan, Commander of the Naval Sea Systems Command, sent out a letter entitled: Ship Design and Analysis Tool Goals. The purpose of the widely distributed memorandum was to state the requirements and high-level capability goals for NAVSEA design synthesis and analysis tools. In this memo, Admiral Sullivan expressed the need for evolving models and analysis tools to be compatible with, among other things, set-based design (SBD). Admiral Sullivan’s memo was a major step toward improving ship design programs with new, more powerful analytical support tools but many have asked, ‘‘What is Set-Based Design and how does it relate to Naval Ship Design?’’ SBD is a complex design method that requires a shift in how one thinks about and manages design. The SBD paradigm can replace point-based design construction with design discovery; it allows more of the design effort to proceed concurrently and defers detailed specifications until trade-offs are more fully understood. This paper describes the principles of SBD citing improvements SBD in design practice that have set the stage for SBD, and relating these principles to current Navy ship design issues.},

This manuscript explores a model updating approach based on fusing different visually observable physical records of structural degradation: permanent set of plating and fatigue crack initiation. A probabilistic S-N fatigue model is coupled to a permanent set model via a Bayesian network. Observations of permanent set and fatigue cracks are entered as evidence into this network. Through Bayesian inference, the network updates underlying loading and fatigue capacity models. These updated models are then used to forecast future failures. The proposed model is tested against Monte Carlo simulated service history data on ﬁve vessels from a larger ﬂeet. The fusion of permanent set and fatigue together produces a more accurate estimate of future failures than using either failure mode alone. The beneﬁt of fusing multiple visually observable measurements to update underlying structural models to provide ﬂeet-wide prognosis appears promising, with further improvements possible with additional reﬁnement.},

A lot of risk analyses have been performed to actually estimate a risk proﬁle under both uncertain future states of hazard sources and undesirable scenarios. Unfortunately, in case of considering speciﬁc systems such as a radioactive waste disposal facility, since the behaviour of future scenarios is hardly predicted without special reasoning process, we cannot estimate their risk only with a traditional risk analysis methodology. Moreover, we believe that the sources of uncertainty at future states can be reduced pertinently by setting up dependency relationships interrelating geological, hydrological, and ecological aspects of the site with all the scenarios. It is then required current methodology of uncertainty analysis of the waste disposal facility be revisited under this belief.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ress.2014.04.024},
	abstract = {In this paper, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to construct a knowledge model for pipe breaks in a water zone. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to model drinking water distribution system pipe breaks using BBNs. Development of expert systems such as BBNs for analyzing drinking water distribution system data is not only important for pipe break prediction, but is also a ﬁrst step in preventing water loss and water quality deterioration through the application of machine learning techniques to facilitate data-based distribution system monitoring and asset management. Due to the difﬁculties in collecting, preparing, and managing drinking water distribution system data, most pipe break models can be classiﬁed as “statistical–physical” or “hypothesis-generating.” We develop the BBN with the hope of contributing to the “hypothesis-generating” class of models, while demonstrating the possibility that BBNs might also be used as “statistical–physical” models. Our model is learned from pipe breaks and covariate data from a mid-Atlantic United States (U.S.) drinking water distribution system network. BBN models are learned using a constraint-based method, a score-based method, and a hybrid method. Model evaluation is based on log-likelihood scoring. Sensitivity analysis using mutual information criterion is also reported. While our results indicate general agreement with prior results reported in pipe break modeling studies, they also suggest that it may be difﬁcult to select among model alternatives. This model uncertainty may mean that more research is needed for understanding whether additional pipe break risk factors beyond age, break history, pipe material, and pipe diameter might be important for asset management planning.},

	abstract = {Naval ship design is a complex process involving the integration of many subsystems into a final design which must simultaneously meet cost and effectivenessmeasures. Alternative ship designs cannot be built and tested due to the cost, effort, and time involved in the design and construction. While scale modeling continues to be widely used in the design process, more computer models are being employed to generate metrics to predict the range of capabilitiesfor alternative ship designs due to the reduced cost of assessing an increased number of concept design alternatives, as well as the improved availability of validated computational tools. Thus in the current acquisition environment, computational tools are necessary to support the design decision making process throughout the product development process. This paper outlines several alternative design philosophy implementationsfor design decision making: weighted sum, hierarchical weighted sum, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and multiattribute utility (MAU) analysis. Finallx a quantitative method for cost-effectiveness trade-off is presented which can be implemented with any of the four decision making models. A DDG-51 ship design example is presented using all four methods, as well as for the cost-effectiveness tradeoff. The characteristics of each method are summarized.},

	abstract = {The effects of bias can influence the design process by impacting the design decisions that are made. While in some cases this bias is beneficial, there are many instances where bias negatively affects the design process and causes complete design failure. Designers require leading or real-time indicators to respond quickly and prevent bias from propagating. Current methods for addressing bias are limited in their scope and do not provide a platform sufficient for early-stage design processes. This paper presents a framework for studying the effects of bias by investigating the structure of the temporal design process. To provide a comparison, biased and nonbiased datasets are generated using an adapted genetic algorithm. The design process datasets are then represented in network space and analysed by out-degree and closeness centrality metrics. A case study is presented using the Sen Bulker ship synthesis model to demonstrate the framework and measures of bias. In conclusion, the network metrics were found to successfully differentiate between the biased and nonbiased datasets within the scope of the case study.},
